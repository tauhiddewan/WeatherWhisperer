# WeatherWhisperer

## Overview

Welcome to WeatherWhisperer, your ultimate destination for weather information in cool districts worldwide! Our Cool Districts Weather API empowers users to explore destinations with delightful weather for their travel plans. Additionally, you can obtain temperature predictions for a specific date!

## Performance Note
- Please note that the initial response may take longer than 0.5 seconds due to the download time from the open-meteo API. Subsequent API calls return responses within 0.5 seconds.
- Additionally, be aware that the XGBoost library may take some time to download during the setup process.
